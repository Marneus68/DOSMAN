Since DOSMAN is a DOSBox, it requires the `dosbox` executable to be in the path. Most packages provided by the major GNU/Linux distributions will install DOSBox correctly.\r\n\r\nOn debian based systems, gtkmm 3.0 and its developement headers can be installed by running the following command as root:    \r\n\r\n    apt-get install libgtkmm-3.0 libgtkmm-3.0-dev\r\n\r\n\r\nBuiling\r\n-------\r\n\r\nDOSMAN uses Make and g++. To build it, move to the project's directory and run:    \r\n\r\n    make\r\n\r\n\r\nInstalling and Uninstalling\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nInstalling and uninstalling can be done from the project's Makefile with\r\n\r\n    sudo make install\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n    sudo make uninstall\r\n\r\nRunning\r\n-------\r\n\r\nOnce installed, run `dosman` to start the program. A directory will be created a `~/.dosman` to hold you programs and default configurations.  \r\nSince DOSMAN is a clean front-end, you can actually modify every file in every sub-directory. There is no database involved, DOSMAN works on flat files and directory structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
